## 🔵 Phase 3: Polish & Launch Prep

### ⏳ Before First Deploy
- [ ] **Install Rust toolchain** on dev machine
- [ ] **Run `cargo check`** to confirm compilation
- [ ] **Install Docker Desktop** (if not already)
- [ ] **`docker compose build app`** - verify Docker build
- [ ] **`docker compose up -d`** - full local spin-up test
- [ ] **Hit `localhost:8080/health`** - confirm API responds
- [ ] **Register a tenant** via POST /api/tenants
- [ ] **Create a user**, auth flow end-to-end
- [ ] **Team member management** — each tenant can have team members (users with roles like admin/member), limited by plan level
  - Basic plan: 1 user (the owner)
  - Pro plan: up to 5 team members
  - Enterprise: unlimited
  - This is NOT tenant sub-hierarchy — sister companies don't have tenants, they have team access
  - `users.invite` webhook action exists already
- [ ] **Run seed data** - confirm pipelines, plans, default templates load
- [ ] **Send a test email** - verify Mailpit captures it
- [ ] **Send a test SMS via Telnyx** (uses real API - test with a free credit)
- [ ] **SSL cert setup** - for production API domain

### ⏳ Security Hardening
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - verify AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE and API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE work
- [ ] **Input validation** - audit all POST/PATCH/PUT handlers for missing validation
- [ ] **CORS** - tighten to specific origins in production
- [ ] **JWT rotation** - add token blacklist on password change
- [ ] **SQL injection** - verify all queries use sqlx parameterized binds (not format!/raw strings)
- [ ] **Audit log review** - make sure sensitive actions (delete, role change, payment) all log

## 🟣 Phase 4: Feature Gaps & Enhancements

### ✅ Self-Service Account Onboarding (Done - Migration 026)
- ✅ Every person who signs up gets their own isolated account (tenant) - no shared accounts
- ✅ Admins and tenants are the same: both are account holders with their own login
- ✅ Register creates a new tenant automatically (auto-generates name/slug from email)
- ✅ Register returns tenant info + next steps in response
- ✅ First user in tenant gets "owner" role (full admin access)
- ✅ Invite system - owners/admins can create invite links to add team members
  - `POST /api/auth/invite` - create invite (role: admin/member, 7-day expiry)
  - `GET /api/auth/invites` - list active invites
  - Register with `invite_token` joins that existing tenant
- ✅ Clean separation: FunnelSwift admin, MissedCall admin, tenants - each their own account

### ✅ Native App Integration System (Done - Migration 025 + 6 connector files)
- ✅ 6 native app connectors with per-tenant credential storage
- ✅ AdaSwift (admin-only) - client portal, push contacts, trigger campaigns
- ✅ CheatLayer (admin-only) - RPA engine, trigger workflows
- ✅ FunnelSwift (admin+tenant) - push/pull leads, funnels
- ✅ WorkflowSwift (admin+tenant) - trigger/pull n8n workflows
- ✅ MissedCall Responder (admin+tenant) - push leads, pull conversations, trigger SMS replies
- ✅ Multi-Directory App (admin+tenant) - sync business listings, pull reviews/analytics
- ✅ Ada Campaign Triggers - replaces Mailgun for welcome emails + scan reports
  - Triggers: user_created, contact_created, account_activated, scan_complete
  - CRM Swift automation rules now fire Ada campaigns instead of raw email
- ✅ Each app gets its own connection login - separate API keys per app per tenant, isolated sync audit trails
- ✅ **Affiliate product board** - products/services with tags, commissions, checkout links
- ✅ **Public webhook** (`POST /api/webhook/{token}/{action}`) - single endpoint for WorkflowSwift to orchestrate all automation
  - Every tenant gets an auto-generated webhook token on signup
  - Supports 28+ actions across all features (contacts, tags, lists, pipelines, affiliates, comms, AI, events, billing)
  - Full audit log of every webhook call
  - Admins/tenants don't need direct OpenClaw/n8n/CheatLayer access - they connect once to WorkflowSwift
  - WorkflowSwift uses this webhook internally to talk to CRM Swift

### 🏛 Affiliate Email Delivery (via Ada campaigns)
- CRM Swift also powers the in-house affiliate system's email delivery
- Instead of sending commission notifications / payout alerts / referral confirmations through raw SMTP:
  - Affiliate gets a new referral → CRM Swift triggers Ada campaign → Ada sends referral confirmation
  - Commission earned → CRM Swift triggers Ada campaign → Ada sends commission notification
  - Payout processed → CRM Swift triggers Ada campaign → Ada sends payout alert
- Uses the same Ada campaign trigger system already built
- Triggers supported: `referral_confirmed`, `commission_earned`, `payout_processed`, `affiliate_activated`

### ✅ Admin Chat Actions (Done - full business from Telegram)
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/chat-action` - single endpoint to drive the entire business
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/chat-action/intents` - discover all available actions
- ✅ **create_affiliate** - creates CRM Swift account + affiliate profile + code + login
- ✅ **create_affiliate_in_funnelswift** - creates FunnelSwift product + CRM Swift account + tag + Ada welcome campaign
- ✅ **create_tenant_account** - creates tenant + admin user + free plan + auto webhook token
- ✅ Missing field prompts - returns specific fields it needs so I can ask you in chat
- ✅ Multi-step flow - one intent auto-triggers across CRM Swift + FunnelSwift + AdaSwift
- ✅ Example: "create affiliate John Doe" → I prompt for email/rate → you reply → full setup done
- ✅ **Affiliate self-serve product selection** (Migration 028)
  - `GET /api/affiliates/my-products` - affiliates see what they're promoting + what's available
  - `POST /api/affiliates/my-products/select` - start promoting a product
  - `POST /api/affiliates/my-products/unselect` - stop promoting
  - Affiliates log into FunnelSwift back-end to pick which products to promote
  - Available via webhook: `affiliate_products.my`, `affiliate_products.select`, `affiliate_products.unselect`
- ✅ **tenants.create webhook action** - FunnelSwift calls `POST /api/webhook/{token}/tenants.create` with affiliate's name/email → CRM Swift auto-creates tenant + owner user + free plan + affiliate profile + code
  - This is how FunnelSwift triggers the account creation when someone signs up as an affiliate
  - No need for CRM Swift front-end signup - all automation originates from FunnelSwift level
- ✅ **12 new webhook actions filling remaining gaps** - complete automation coverage
  - `webhooks.generate` - Create a new webhook token (no chicken-and-egg problem; admin token exists)
  - `webhooks.revoke` - Deactivate a token
  - `webhooks.list` - List all tokens (masked)
  - `pipelines.stages` - List stages for a pipeline
  - `pipelines.create_stage` - Create a new stage
  - `users.invite` - Invite a team member
  - `users.list` - List tenant users
  - `tenants.settings` - Get tenant config
  - `scoring.calculate` - Recalculate contact score
  - `analytics.contacts` - Contact analytics summary
  - `audit.log` - Recent audit log entries
  - `search.query` - Cross-entity search (contacts, tags, lists)
  - All 12 added to auto-generated webhook token allowed_actions in migration 027

### ⏳ Next Up
